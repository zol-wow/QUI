# QUI 2.0 – A QuaziiUI Community Legacy Edition

**A community-maintained fork / continuation of QuaziiUI (QUI) in the spirit of its original creator.**

This project is **not** an official continuation from Quazii. It is a heartfelt community effort to keep the clean, performant, and beautiful UI design alive after the unfortunate events that led to Quazii stepping away from the WoW addon scene.

### Why This Exists

Quazii created one of the most loved and polished UI packages for World of Warcraft – especially in the Midnight era. Many players (myself included) still rely on its design philosophy: minimalism, performance in high-end content (Mythic+, Raiding), and pixel-perfect scaling without the bloat.

After the recent drama involving code disputes, monetization concerns, and Quazii's decision to retire from the scene, the original QUI is no longer being updated or supported. This repo aims to:

- Preserve the core vision and feel of QuaziiUI
- Make it freely available to everyone (no Patreon, no paid installers – pure open-source)
- Fix compatibility issues for current WoW patches (e.g., Midnight 12.0+)
- Use public, community-approved libraries to avoid any past controversies (e.g., pixel-perfect scaling via MIT-licensed sources)
- Keep the UI as a free resource for the community that Quazii once built it for

This is done **in the spirit of Quazii** – not to compete, not to profit, but to honor the passion he put into UI customization for over 20 years of WoW.

I cleaned up and re-organized the code base, removed the controversial PixelPerfect code snippets likely copied from ElvUI, and merged some of the open feature branches from before Quazii's exit. The rest is basically the state of **QuaziiUI v1.99b**.
